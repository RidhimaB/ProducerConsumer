1.Theare are three classes
  MyConsumer
MyProducer
Producerconsumer



2.
You have to open Producerconsumer class
This is main class where you can execute the applicaiton
and you can find the comments on every method  bcz for comments and stylish code they give 5%

for report 20%
for smooth execution 75%

i have covered all the things let me show you
keep your name


Here two threads 
1.Producer 
2.Consumer

As per the document
let me open

You have to maintain buffer size 10
it means You have to create BlockingQueue Object which will have size 10
it can store only 10 msgs
every time producer store one msg
consumer consume the msg form buffer

it happens till 15 sec of execution

once buffer size reach 10 then producer wil not store msg in buffer
it watis for consumer randomly

max ineter size 14 it means it has to start 0-14 then repeats


producer-consumer problem using bounded
buffer whose size is 10.


int bufferSize=10;
	    int waitingPeriodMin=10;
	    int waitingPeriodMax=100;
	    int max_terminationTime=15;
	    int max_generates_integers=14;
	    String logPath = "D:";

above values are configured dynamically it means
in progream did not hardcode any where


this is called sytylish program

if you do not have D:/ drive then change accordingly
and while giving to college we have to remove Sysout's

if you want to check out put conole then make uncomment

finally we have to submit

1.Program
2.report
have to make zip file

if you need you can keep sample output files
like producer.txt ,consumer.txt files 


let me show you report.txt

in report if you want you can add if you have points or you want to elebrate more



Plz make sure zip shuold have only source code and report

yu have to share that zip only
before share plz make sure
Drive 

in local you have D:/ but in college you may or may not 
plz check with them once and change accordingly


i give you eclipse project and zip file

just run the program and try to undrstand the code

do you have any doubts

you have access you can type here
bhaiya i didnt know that

the drive i will change to C is that okay?

yes
you can keep any driver
better make c bcz every system wil have C
but some times C drive will not have permison to write files 


so  we have to make sure that one

and next i have to enter my name i

n type here u r name i wil add

Ridhima

done

I dont have any doubts bhaiya it is clear explanation
ok cool

Thank u amazing class
lol
haha!


bhlet aya i want this saved as well to review what u told

ok let me send all


what is the your project name
same name keep to your zip and append your stduent num or something

Just ridhima programming project



let me show how to take project in eclipse
create a Java Prject thjen finish it

you can find src folder 
just paste all java files only

on porgram 
right click
if you want to see console out put just uncomment sysout

that's it


if you do not have eclipse in u r College but you want to run the program then 

you have to choose command promt only

bhaiya u told that while submitting i should remove sysout right?


but if they askyou to execute 
if you execute the program then only prducer.txt and consumer.txt files only will generate into log path

okay bhaiya i will keep sysout
but while submiting remove it
then it geneates producer.txt file and consumer.txt file it will not have console out put
if you keep sysout you will get three 
producer.txt and conusmer.txt and console out put



let me show you how to run applicaiton from commandpromt

place all three java files into one folder

if you install java then you can run from command promt

you can check it whether java installed or not


just type java command you can see like out put if you do not have you can't see any thing
then download java and install it

i have java installed bhaiya
ok cool

Steps to run program from command promt

1.Place all files into one folder
2.Complie all three java files
        javac <javafile name>

D:\PCProbram>javac MyConsumer.java

D:\PCProbram>javac MyProducer.java

D:\PCProbram>javac ProducerConsumer.java

then run the program (do not keep .java extension)

3. java ProducerConsumer

if you do not keep sysout you can see only 
D:\PCProbram>java ProducerConsumer
Process Starting ..1460048862457
Total Processed Time :15 Sec

and two files will be generated

if you keep sysout you can console out and two files will be generated

clear ?

yes

i will send mail
